# React Native Expo Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), a framework and platform for universal React applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd your-project
    ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `expo ios`

Like `expo start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `expo android`

Like `expo start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator.

#### `expo web`

Like `expo start`, but also attempts to open your app on a web browser.

#### `expo build:android` and `expo build:ios`

Builds your app into a binary for Android or iOS, respectively.
